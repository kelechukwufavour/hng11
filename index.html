                            A revelation during the recent She Code Africa summit left a lasting impression on me: "Behind a successful woman is a whole village of helpers" (Jola Aderemi-Makinde, 2023). 
                            This insight highlighted the significance of teamwork in achieving success, emphasizing the importance of leaning on others for support. Reflecting on this,
                            I embraced the notion that, like a garden composed of diverse flowers, a community thrives on a variety of strengths, perspectives, and characteristics.
